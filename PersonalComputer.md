# Marine Hydro notebooks on your personal computer

The Marine Hydro notebooks can be opened and used directly from your browser (just click on this badge [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org:/repo/weymouth/marinehydro)). This is achieved by running the notebooks on a computer cluster at google ([FAQs](http://docs.mybinder.org/faq)). 

However, if you want to be able to run the notebooks on your personal computer (which could be useful for modifying your work later), it is straightforward. 

1.  [Install jupyter](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)

	“The Jupyter Notebook is a web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text.“ – [Jupyter.org](http://Jupyter.org)

2.  Copy the MarineHydro notebooks to your computer

	_Option A_: [download the zipfile](archive/master.zip), and then unzip
  
	_Option B_: [use `git` to `fork` the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)

	If you are interested in coding, or need to code for your IP/MSc project, you should be using `git`. [Github has a nice set of introduction/help documents.](https://help.github.com/)

3.  [Run the notebooks with jupyter](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html#running)
