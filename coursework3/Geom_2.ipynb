    "##### Geometry\n",
    "\n",
    "The hydrofoil will be modelled as a cambered 2D foil section. You can choose one of the foil sections we looked at in the module or find an alternative in the literature (some level of approximation in that case is fine). Use the same thickness $t/c$ as the symetric foil studied in the module to facilitate comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Parametric study \n",
    "\n",
    "You will study the impact of the maximum camber $m$ nondimensionalized by the chord $c$ while keeping the other section properties fixed. Use as many values as you need to identify the trends in the range $0\\le m/c\\le 10\\%$. Make sure the geometry and resulting flow are reasonable across the parameter range.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Performance metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Predict the total lift and drag on the foil and the point of separation $x/c$ on the upper and lower surfaces over the parameter range. Compare the camber foil results to the symmetric foil we studied in the module. Determine the added mass of the foil due to motion in $x$ and $y$ over the parameter range. Make sure to explain and validate any code you develop for these metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Discuss how you could use your results to determine the optimal $m/c$ for the hydrofoil given a particular hull weight and speed. Discuss if camber or angle of attack is the better choice for a hydrofoil. Discuss the advantages and limitations of this analysis. "
