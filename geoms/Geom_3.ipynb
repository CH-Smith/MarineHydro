    "##### Geometry\n",
    "\n",
    "The AUV will be modelled as two symmetric hulls aligned vertically. Design an appropriate hull geometry with an aspect ratio of $c/t=8$ and a 2D block coefficient of $A/(t*c)\\ge 0.8$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Parametric study \n",
    "\n",
    "You will study the impact of the vertical gap between the hulls $g$ versus the hull chord $c$  while keeping the hull design fixed. Use as many values as you need to identify the trends in the range  $5\\le g/c \\le 1/4$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Performance metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Predict the total drag on the body and the point of separation $x/c$ on the upper and lower surfaces over the parameter range. Use $n=128$ and the second order panels and include an image of the panels and end points.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Discuss how you could use your results to determine the optimal $g/c$ for the AUV. Discuss what other factors might be important. Discuss the advantages and limitations of this analysis. "
